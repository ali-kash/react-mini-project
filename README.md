# React Mini Project

Basic React project with Node.js, grocery list api

## Directions

- This repo is a fresh create-react-app install, with an added server endpoint that will return a JSON response of products. The endpoint to hit is simply `/api`.
- The goal is to update the homepage with a product listing built from that response.
- A wonderful design is not required, but a clean UX is appreciated.
- There is no correct solution. This will be a basis for conversation about how you went about solving the problems.
- Aside from the `id` key, you should include all of the data from the response in your UI.

## Some things to note

- Images are intentionally random sizes
- Out of stock products styled differently (i.e. inventory being `0`)
- `featured` products styled differently
- Beware of missing or `null` data
